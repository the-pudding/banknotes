(This is just a thought experiment, we don’t need your credit card information, don’t worry). You might see America’s founding fathers George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln or Alexander Hamilton. Maybe you see former heads of government Andrew Jackson or Ulysses S. Grant."},{"type":"image","value":{"id":"placeholder","caption":"Array of front sides of US banknotes depicting portraits of America's founding fathers."}},{"type":"text","value":"And if you're reading this from <select id=\"country-selector\" name=\"country-selector\"></select>,you’re probably looking at people who made history in your country. Without even noticing, the faces of prominent people are always in your wallet but have you ever questioned who gets to be on banknotes?"},{"type":"viz","value":{"id":"viz1"}},{"type":"text","value":"Beyond their utilitarian purpose, the banknotes in your wallet encapsulate the history, language and culture of the place you live in, including the larger social and institutional issues that countries battle with everyday. Many countries have an overwhelming representation of aristocratic men in banknotes, relegating to the sidelines the faces of women and people from racial and ethnic minorities that have been just as instrumental (if not more so) to their country’s development."},{"type":"text","value":"Some countries are trying to make the future of banknotes much more representative of their societies through nationwide design contests and diverse selection committees. But as you’ll see in our analysis, we still have a long way to go to achieve equitable representation in the banknotes of the world."},{"type":"text","value":"We decided to investigate the people who appear on banknotes around the world, to see what we could learn about these people and what they could tell us about their countries. We gathered the data from the official websites of national central banks, the Standard Catalog of World Paper Money, 25th Edition, Wikipedia’s list of people on banknotes,  and multiple biographies about the individuals."},{"type":"text","value":"Since we wanted to learn more about the specific people on banknotes, we narrowed our investigation to banknotes with non-generic people on them. This means that the country has explicitly said that the portrait in the banknote belongs to a specific person and it’s not an unspecified representation of a villager, a woman, a fictional character, etc."},{"type":"text","value":"Another condition we followed was to only count circulating banknotes that aren’t being recalled. This way we are only looking at bills that are and will continue to be legal tender for the foreseeable future."},{"type":"text","value":"We wanted this analysis to be as international as possible so we inquired into countries from all 22 sub and sub-subregions of the world, based on the United Nations’ Statistics Department geoscheme. Out of the 22 regions, we found that 21 had countries with currencies that met our criteria so our study includes at least one country per region. The only region not in our analysis was Western Europe because none of its countries include people in their circulating banknotes."},{"type":"image","value":{"id":"placeholder","caption":"Map of the entire world"}},{"type":"text","value":"In total, we analyzed 243 unique people on banknotes from 38 countries. Fifty-three were women (22% of portraits) and 190 were men. This comes down to be 236 unique bills. Why are the numbers of unique people and unique banknotes different? Well, several countries feature the same person on multiple banknotes like Bangladesh, which has their Founding Father in all nine of their denominations. For the purpose of counting unique people, Bangladesh’s founding father would be counted as a single person but he would count as nine unique bills. Other countries have multiple portraits in one banknote, like the 10 CAD banknote which includes the portraits of four prominent Canadians. Each Canadian would be counted as a unique person but together would count as a single bill."},{"type":"text","value":"We looked at their professions and accomplishments, among other characteristics, to understand who are on the banknotes of the world, and what it took to get there."}],"occupation":[{"type":"heading","value":{"title":"Writing influential work can get you on a banknote"}},{"type":"text","value":"Writing influential work can get you on a banknote. Coming into this analysis, we suspected that the people on banknotes would mostly be heads of government and monarchs, since they hold so much power and oftentimes have the last word on economic matters. We were surprised to find that writers were the most popular choice. But of course, they aren’t just any writers. The writers on banknotes are influential thinkers who shaped their countries’ literature and whose work is known by heart and praised by many."},{"type":"text","value":"Nineteen percent of the people featured on banknotes were Writers (45 people from 23 countries) which makes writing the most common profession among currency individuals. Many of those classified as writers have a diverse portfolio which spans from poetry and fiction to journalism and academic writing, so we opted for classifying them as writers at large. Writing is the most common profession among women (14 women) and the second most common for men (31 men)."},{"type":"viz","value":{"id":"viz2"}},{"type":"text","value":"Some notable figures in this category include Colombia’s first Nobel Prize of Literature winner Gabriel García Márquez, the pioneer of Japanese modern literature Ichiyo Higuchi and Turkish writer Fatma Aliye Topuz who is known as the first female author in the Islamic world. Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine have the most writers among their banknotes with four writers each. In fact, Israel only features Hebrew poets in their current banknotes. According to the Bank of Israel, the New Shekel “carry portraits of outstanding Hebrew poets whose life stories, works, and activities are intertwined with the story of the rebirth of the Nation of Israel in its land.”"},{"type":"text","value":"The New Shekel is an example of radical changes in banknote imagery throughout the years. Before the Shekel was founded, the first Israeli Lira depicted landscapes and the second series depicted “drawings of people illustrating different walks of Israeli life”. It was not until the third series in 1970 that there were portraits of specific people from history. From 1980 to 2014, the Israeli Shekel showed portraits of five former heads of government."},{"type":"text","value":"The designer of the current Israeli banknotes, Osnat Eshel, told newspaper Haaretz that she was “brought up with Hebrew poetry at home” and that’s why she felt so dearly about creating designs inspired by their widely known poems. This example could indicate that citizens might have deep emotional connections with the works of writers which makes them a great choice to represent national identity on banknotes."},{"type":"text","value":"However, Amit Trainin, head of the Visual Communication Department at Tel Aviv's Minshar for Art, has a different take on why writers are a subject of choice for banknotes, telling Haaretz: “if we’re going to have bombastic national symbols [on banknotes], better poor poets than rich generals.”"},{"type":"text","value":"While notable writers might seem like a safe choice for banknotes, their selection can still perpetuate divisions in the population. Many decried that the current Israeli series only represented Ashkenazi Jews and didn’t include anyone of Sephardi or Mizrahi heritage, an exclusion that some hope will be solved in following editions."}]}
