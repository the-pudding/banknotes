This means that the country has explicitly said that the portrait on the banknote belongs to a specific person and it’s not an unspecified representation of a villager, a woman, a fictional character, etc."},{"type":"text","value":"Another condition we followed was to only count circulating banknotes that aren’t being recalled. This way we are only looking at bills that are and will continue to be legal tender for the foreseeable future."},{"type":"text","value":"We drew inspiration from a 2016 article by Vox about women on world banknotes. Since then, the data has changed so we collected updated numbers for this article."},{"type":"text","value":"Please remember that the conclusions and statistics presented in this article are only applicable for the countries analyzed. Collecting updated data on world banknotes is difficult because there isn’t a centralized governing body that keeps up-to-date records. Another limitation was that we are only proficient in English and Spanish but some countries' central bank websites weren’t available in those languages so we couldn’t cross-reference the data."},{"type":"text","value":"If you would like to do extra research on the topic, refer to Standard Catalog of World Paper Money 25th Edition or Wikipedia’s list of people on banknotes but again, remember these resources aren’t updated all the time and you might have to cross-reference with other resources. Many countries keep thorough records of their money on their central bank’s website so that is a good resource too."}]}]}
