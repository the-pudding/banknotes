For the purpose of counting unique people, Bangladesh’s founding father would be counted as a single person but he would count as nine unique bills. Other countries have multiple portraits in one banknote, like the 10 CAD banknote which includes the portraits of four prominent Canadians. Each Canadian would be counted as a unique person but together would count as a single bill."}},{"type":"textBasic","value":[{"type":"text","value":"Some notable figures in this category include Colombia’s first Nobel Prize of Literature winner Gabriel García Márquez, the pioneer of Japanese modern literature Ichiyo Higuchi and Turkish writer Fatma Aliye Topuz who is known as the first female author in the Islamic world."},{"type":"text","value":"The designer of the current Israeli banknotes, Osnat Eshel, told newspaper Haaretz that she was “brought up with Hebrew poetry at home” and that’s why she felt so dearly about creating designs inspired by their widely known poems.
